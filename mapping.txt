# Mapping of fields from CSV columns to TXT

# Dots in the TXT are interpreted as sub-objects, e.g. gfx.city.x means
# gfx = { city = { x = <value> } }

# list is a special value meaning that there is a list here, e.g. gfx.river.list
# means gfx = { river = { <value> } }
# and if there are multiple columns mapped to the same list, just append them.

# The string "unused" means a CSV field is not present in the TXT
# The column number "-1" means a TXT value is not present in CSV
